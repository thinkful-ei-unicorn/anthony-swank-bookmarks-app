This is my bookmark App! Fulfilled all requirements and user stories and ready to go! This bookmark has a very basic design, with fully functional features that anyone can take advantage of.

My bookmark can add bookmarks to a list. The bookmark includes a space for a:

-title -url link -description -rating (1-5)

When you open the app, you can see all added bookmarks immediately in front. They show the title and rating only, but can be expanded to show the entire bookmark.

You can delete bookmarks from my list at any time.

Feedback is given when you aren't able to submit/add a bookmark to the list. (Missing requirements, etc.)

You can filter your bookmarks list by rating, hide unrated bookmarks, or show all bookmarks.
